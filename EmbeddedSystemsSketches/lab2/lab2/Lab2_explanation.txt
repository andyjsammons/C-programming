A clear explanation of how many and what resistors are needed in the circuit:

Since a regular red LED has a forward voltage of 1.7V, I've assumed that the blue LED
has the same VF.

In this case, I've provided both of the LED's on my breadboard with 100 Ohm resistors,
since we do not have the 80 Ohm resistors required to handle the voltage drop of 1.6V
over the circuit.

So two 100 Ohm resistors are used per LED.
